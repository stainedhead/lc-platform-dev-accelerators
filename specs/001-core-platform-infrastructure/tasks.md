# Tasks: Cloud-Agnostic Service Layer Implementation

**Feature**: 001-core-platform-infrastructure
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-core-platform-infrastructure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/all-services.ts

**Tests**: TDD is mandatory (Constitution Principle II). All test tasks MUST be completed and FAIL before implementation begins.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single TypeScript package**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Hexagonal architecture: `src/core/` (interfaces), `src/providers/` (implementations), `src/factory/` (factory pattern)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure per research.md decisions

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T011 [P] Implement LCPlatformError class hierarchy in src/core/types/common.ts (ResourceNotFoundError, ServiceUnavailableError, QuotaExceededError, ValidationError, AuthenticationError)
- [X] T012 [P] Create provider factory pattern in src/factory/ProviderFactory.ts
- [X] T013 [P] Implement retry logic utility with exponential backoff in src/utils/retry.ts (3 attempts default, respects Retry-After headers)
- [X] T014 [P] Implement LRU cache wrapper in src/utils/cache.ts (for secrets and configuration caching per SC-004, SC-005)
- [X] T015 [P] Implement input validation utilities in src/utils/validation.ts
- [X] T016 Create main LCPlatform class skeleton in src/LCPlatform.ts with factory methods for all 11 services
- [X] T017 [P] Setup LocalStack docker-compose.yml for integration testing (S3, SQS, SNS, EventBridge, Secrets Manager, AppConfig, Batch services)
- [X] T018 [P] Create base test utilities for Bun test in tests/helpers/test-utils.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US3 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US4 (P3): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US5 (P3): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US6 (P3): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US7 (P4): Depends on US1-US6 completion (validation story)
- **Authentication (Phase 10)**: Can start after Foundational - Cross-cutting concern
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

All user stories are designed to be independently implementable after Foundational phase:

- **US1 (Deploy Web App)**: Independent - WebHosting, DataStore, ObjectStore services
- **US2 (Batch Jobs)**: Independent - Batch, Queue services (uses ObjectStore from US1 but doesn't depend on US1 completion)
- **US3 (Secrets/Config)**: Independent - Secrets, Configuration services
- **US4 (Events)**: Independent - EventBus service
- **US5 (Notifications)**: Independent - Notification service
- **US6 (Documents)**: Independent - DocumentStore service
- **US7 (Migration)**: Depends on US1-US6 (validates provider abstraction)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)
- Type definitions before interfaces
- Interfaces before implementations
- Mock provider before AWS provider
- Factory methods after provider implementations
- Integration tasks after core implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003, T004, T005, T006, T008, T009 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T011, T013, T014, T015, T017, T018 can run in parallel
- **Within each User Story**:
  - All contract tests can run in parallel
  - All unit tests can run in parallel
  - All integration tests can run in parallel
  - All type definitions can run in parallel
  - All interface definitions can run in parallel
  - Mock and AWS provider implementations can run in parallel (different files)
- **Across User Stories**: After Foundational phase completes, US1-US6 can be developed in parallel by different team members
- **Phase 11 (Polish)**: T131-T136, T139-T142 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

This delivers immediate value - developers can deploy web applications with database and storage:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T018) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T044)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently with quickstart.md examples
5. Deploy/demo MVP capability

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks (Week 1: Setup + Foundational, Weeks 2-3: US1)

### Incremental Delivery

Each user story adds value without breaking previous stories:

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (Week 1)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Weeks 2-3) ‚úÖ MVP
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Week 4)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Week 5)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Week 6)
6. Add User Stories 5-6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Week 7)
7. Add Authentication (Phase 10) ‚Üí Test (Week 7)
8. Complete Polish & Cross-Cutting (Phase 11) ‚Üí Release 1.0.0 (Week 8)

**Total Estimated Effort**: 7-8 weeks (aligns with research.md phasing)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Stories 1 + 4 (WebHosting, DataStore, ObjectStore, EventBus)
- **Developer B**: User Stories 2 + 5 (Batch, Queue, Notification)
- **Developer C**: User Stories 3 + 6 (Secrets, Configuration, DocumentStore)
- **All together**: Authentication (Phase 10) + Polish (Phase 11)

Stories complete and integrate independently, enabling parallel development.

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 147
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: 26 tasks (9 tests + 17 implementation)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: 18 tasks (6 tests + 12 implementation)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: 20 tasks (6 tests + 14 implementation)
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: 11 tasks (3 tests + 8 implementation)
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- **Phase 8 (US6)**: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- **Phase 9 (US7)**: 7 tasks (3 tests + 4 implementation)
- **Phase 10 (Authentication)**: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- **Phase 11 (Polish)**: 17 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 85 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
**User Story Coverage**: All 7 user stories from spec.md mapped to implementation tasks
**Independent Testing**: Each user story has independent test criteria and can be validated separately

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label (US1-US7) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- TDD is mandatory - all tests MUST fail before implementation begins
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `bun test --coverage` frequently to verify 80% coverage requirement
- Constitution Principle I enforced: No AWS/Azure types in core interfaces
- Constitution Principle VI enforced: Mock provider for every service interface
