**Feature Branch**: `001-core-platform-infrastructure`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Implement the 11 cloud-agnostic service wrappers for the LCPlatform DevAccelerator package

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-20

- Q: How should the SDK behave when cloud provider services are degraded or unavailable? → A: Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts default), then throw retryable error
- Q: How should the SDK respond when hitting cloud provider rate limits? → A: Respect Retry-After headers, retry with backoff, eventual failure after max attempts
- Q: How long should deleted secrets and configurations be retained before permanent deletion? → A: 30 days
- Q: How should the SDK handle concurrent modification conflicts? → A: Optimistic locking with ETags/versions - Reject updates if version changed, return conflict error
- Q: What are the target availability and recovery objectives for SDK operations? → A: Best-effort

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Deploy Web Application with Database and Storage (Priority: P1)

A developer needs to deploy a web application that requires database connectivity and file storage without being locked into a specific cloud provider.

**Why this priority**: This is the most common deployment scenario and provides immediate value. Developers can deploy production applications without cloud-specific knowledge.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying a simple web app with database and object storage dependencies, verifying the app receives correct connection details and can perform CRUD operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a web application configuration with PostgreSQL database dependency, **When** developer deploys the application, **Then** the application receives database connection credentials and can successfully connect
2. **Given** a deployed web application, **When** application needs to store user-uploaded files, **Then** the application can upload and retrieve files from object storage without knowing the underlying cloud provider
3. **Given** a web application with configuration dependencies, **When** configuration values are updated, **Then** the application automatically receives updated values within the configured refresh interval

---

### User Story 2 - Execute Scheduled Batch Jobs with Queue Processing (Priority: P2)

A data engineer needs to run daily data processing jobs that consume messages from a queue and store results in object storage.

**Why this priority**: Batch processing is a critical enterprise workload that demonstrates async processing capabilities and service integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a batch job that reads from a queue, processes messages, and writes output to storage, then verifying job completion and output artifacts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a batch job configuration with queue and storage dependencies, **When** job is scheduled to run daily at 2 AM, **Then** job executes at the scheduled time and processes all queue messages
2. **Given** a running batch job, **When** job fails mid-execution, **Then** job automatically retries based on configured retry policy and unprocessed messages remain in queue
3. **Given** a completed batch job, **When** reviewing job results, **Then** developer can access execution logs and output files in storage

---

### User Story 3 - Secure Secrets and Configuration Management (Priority: P2)

An operations team needs to manage application secrets and configuration without exposing sensitive data in code or configuration files.

**Why this priority**: Security is critical and this enables zero-trust security practices across all other services.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by storing a database password as a secret, referencing it in an application configuration, and verifying the application receives the decrypted value without it ever appearing in logs or config files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** database credentials stored as secrets, **When** application starts, **Then** application retrieves credentials securely and connects to database without credentials appearing in environment variables or logs
2. **Given** a secret requiring rotation, **When** operations team rotates the secret, **Then** all consuming applications automatically receive the new secret value
3. **Given** application configuration with feature flags, **When** configuration is updated in the configuration service, **Then** running applications receive updated values without restart

---

### User Story 4 - Event-Driven Architecture Implementation (Priority: P3)

A platform architect needs to implement event-driven communication between microservices using publish-subscribe patterns.

**Why this priority**: Event-driven architecture is essential for scalable microservices but can be implemented after core deployment capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by publishing an event from one service and verifying multiple subscriber services receive and process the event.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user service publishing "user.created" events, **When** a new user registers, **Then** all subscribed services (email, analytics, CRM) receive the event and execute their respective actions
2. **Given** multiple event types being published, **When** a service subscribes with event pattern filtering, **Then** service only receives events matching its filter criteria
3. **Given** an event bus with multiple publishers, **When** system experiences high event volume, **Then** events are delivered reliably without loss or duplication

---

### User Story 5 - Multi-Channel Notifications (Priority: P3)

A product team needs to send notifications to users via email, SMS, and push notifications from a single unified interface.

**Why this priority**: Notifications enhance user experience but are not required for core functionality deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering a notification and verifying it's delivered via the specified channel (email/SMS/push).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a notification configuration with email and SMS channels, **When** application sends a notification, **Then** user receives both email and SMS messages
2. **Given** a notification topic with multiple subscribers, **When** message is published to the topic, **Then** all subscribers receive the notification via their preferred channel
3. **Given** a failed notification delivery, **When** reviewing notification logs, **Then** system provides delivery status and failure reason

---

### User Story 6 - Document Database Operations (Priority: P3)

A development team needs to store and query JSON documents with flexible schema for user profiles and session data.

**Why this priority**: Document databases complement relational databases but many applications can start with just relational storage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by inserting JSON documents, querying them with various filters, and verifying correct results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user profile data as JSON documents, **When** storing profiles in document database, **Then** profiles are stored with automatic indexing and can be queried efficiently
2. **Given** documents with varying schemas, **When** querying documents, **Then** queries return matching documents regardless of schema variations
3. **Given** high-volume document writes, **When** system creates indexes, **Then** queries remain performant without degradation

---

### User Story 7 - Cloud Provider Migration (Priority: P4)

An enterprise organization needs to migrate their application from AWS to Azure without rewriting application code.

**Why this priority**: This validates the core value proposition of cloud-agnosticism but isn't needed for initial implementation and deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying the same application configuration to AWS and Azure environments and verifying identical behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application running on AWS, **When** operations team switches provider configuration to Azure, **Then** application redeploys to Azure without code changes
2. **Given** application using all 11 services on AWS, **When** migrated to Azure, **Then** all service integrations work identically with Azure equivalents
3. **Given** a multi-cloud deployment, **When** comparing application behavior, **Then** functional behavior is identical across cloud providers

---

### Edge Cases

- **Service degradation**: When a cloud provider service is temporarily unavailable, SDK automatically retries with exponential backoff (3 attempts default), then throws a retryable error for application-level handling
- **Rate limiting**: SDK respects Retry-After headers from cloud provider APIs, retries with exponential backoff, and throws QuotaExceededError after maximum retry attempts
- **Concurrent modifications**: SDK uses optimistic locking with ETags/version numbers to detect conflicts; update operations are rejected with a conflict error if the resource version has changed since it was read
- What happens when configuration refresh fails during application runtime?
- How are connection pools managed when database connections are interrupted?
- What happens when secret rotation occurs while applications are actively using the secret?
- How does the system handle partial batch job failures where some items succeed and others fail?
- What happens when event delivery fails due to subscriber unavailability?
- How are duplicate messages handled in queue processing?
- What happens when object storage operations timeout during large file uploads?
- How does the system handle authentication failures with workload identity?
