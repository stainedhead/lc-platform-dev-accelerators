# Specification Quality Checklist: Cloud-Agnostic Service Layer Implementation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without implementation details:
- User stories describe business value and user needs
- Requirements specify capabilities without mentioning specific AWS/Azure APIs
- Success criteria measure outcomes (e.g., "deploy in under 5 minutes") not technical metrics (e.g., "API latency")
- TypeScript interfaces mentioned only as deliverables, not implementation constraints

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are well-defined:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- 65 functional requirements clearly stated with MUST statements
- Each requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001: "deploy containerized applications" can be verified by deployment test)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (99.9% success rate, 100ms retrieval time, 1000 msg/sec)
- 7 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- 10 edge cases identified for error handling
- Clear dependencies (SDKs, runtime versions) and assumptions (containerized apps, workload identity)
- Out of scope section clearly defines boundaries (no Azure/GCP implementation, no infrastructure provisioning)

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification is complete and ready for planning:
- All 65 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories cover full lifecycle: deployment (P1), batch processing (P2), security (P2), events (P3), notifications (P3), document storage (P3), cloud migration (P4)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (deployment time, success rates, throughput)
- No technology-specific details in requirements (abstractions only)

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification successfully:
1. Defines all 11 services with clear functional requirements
2. Provides testable acceptance criteria for each capability
3. Establishes measurable success criteria without implementation details
4. Documents assumptions, dependencies, and scope boundaries
5. Maintains cloud-agnostic abstraction throughout

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- Or proceed to `/speckit.tasks` to generate task breakdown

**Recommendation**: This specification is production-ready and requires no clarifications. All requirements are unambiguous and testable.
