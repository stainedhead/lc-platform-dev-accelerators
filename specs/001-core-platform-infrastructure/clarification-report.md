# Clarification Session Report

**Feature**: Cloud-Agnostic Service Layer Implementation
**Branch**: 001-core-platform-infrastructure
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Questions Asked**: 5 of 5 (quota reached)

## Questions & Answers

1. **Service Degradation Response**
   - Q: How should the SDK behave when cloud provider services are degraded or unavailable?
   - A: Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts default), then throw retryable error

2. **Rate Limiting Response**
   - Q: How should the SDK respond when hitting cloud provider rate limits?
   - A: Respect Retry-After headers, retry with backoff, eventual failure after max attempts

3. **Data Retention Policy**
   - Q: How long should deleted secrets and configurations be retained before permanent deletion?
   - A: 30 days

4. **Concurrent Modification Handling**
   - Q: How should the SDK handle concurrent modification conflicts?
   - A: Optimistic locking with ETags/versions - Reject updates if version changed, return conflict error

5. **Availability SLA**
   - Q: What are the target availability and recovery objectives for SDK operations?
   - A: Best-effort

## Sections Updated

1. **Clarifications** - New section created with all Q&A
2. **Edge Cases** - Updated 3 items with concrete behaviors:
   - Service degradation
   - Rate limiting
   - Concurrent modifications
3. **Functional Requirements** - Updated:
   - FR-015: Added 30-day retention for secrets
   - FR-018: Added 30-day retention for configurations
   - FR-066: New requirement for optimistic locking (ETags/versions)
4. **Success Criteria** - Updated:
   - SC-003: Clarified best-effort availability model

## Specification Status

**Updated Spec**: `/Users/iggybdda/Code/stainedhead/Typescript/LCPlatform-DevAccelerator/specs/001-core-platform-infrastructure/spec.md`

**Total Functional Requirements**: 66 (was 65, added FR-066 for concurrency control)

## Coverage Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Functional Scope & Behavior** | ✅ Resolved | All user goals and success criteria clear |
| **Domain & Data Model** | ✅ Resolved | Entities well-defined, retention policies added |

| **Acceptance Criteria** | ✅ Clear | All measurable and testable |

### Deferred Items (Low Impact)

The following edge cases remain as questions but are low priority for initial implementation:

- Configuration refresh failure handling
- Connection pool management during interruptions
- Secret rotation during active use
- Partial batch job failures
- Event delivery failure handling
- Duplicate message handling
- Object storage timeout handling
- Authentication failure handling

**Recommendation**: These can be addressed during implementation planning (`/speckit.plan`) or left for specific implementation decisions. They don't block architectural clarity.

## Impact Assessment

### High Impact (Resolved)
✅ Service degradation behavior - Critical for production reliability
✅ Rate limiting strategy - Essential for API stability
✅ Data retention policies - Required for compliance and recovery
✅ Concurrency control - Prevents data corruption
✅ Availability expectations - Sets realistic SLA boundaries

### Medium Impact (Deferred)
⏸️ Remaining edge cases - Can be handled with standard patterns during implementation

### Low Impact (N/A)
- Accessibility/localization - Not applicable for SDK package
- Compliance specifics - Delegated to cloud providers per assumptions

## Next Steps

**Recommended**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan`

**Rationale**:
- All critical ambiguities resolved (5/5 questions answered)
- Specification now has concrete behaviors for:
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Data lifecycle and retention
  - Concurrency control
  - Availability expectations
- Remaining edge cases are implementation details best addressed in planning phase
- No blocking gaps for architecture or test design

**Alternative**: If you want to address the 7 deferred edge cases, you could run `/speckit.clarify` again, but this is optional and not required for proceeding with planning.
