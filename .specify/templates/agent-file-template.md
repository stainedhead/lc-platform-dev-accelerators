===========================================================================================
NOTE: THIS TEMPLATE IS NOT USED IN THIS PROJECT
===========================================================================================

This project uses a MANUALLY MAINTAINED /AGENTS.md file as the source of truth for all
development rules, standards, and workflows.

/AGENTS.md is NOT auto-generated from feature plans. It is carefully curated and updated
manually to ensure consistency and accuracy.

When making rule changes:
1. Update /AGENTS.md directly (do not use this template)
2. Update .specify/memory/constitution.md if high-level principles change
3. Ensure both files stay synchronized

This template is preserved for reference only and should NOT be used to generate AGENTS.md.
